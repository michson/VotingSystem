            The word “vote” means to choose from a list, to elect or to determine. The main goal of voting (in a scenario involving the student of a given institution) is to come up with leaders of the people’s choice. On-line Voting System is a web based system that facilitates the running of elections and surveys online. Users (student) are individuals who interact with the system. The “Online Voting Software” aims at making the voting process easy in cooperative societies. Presently voting is performed using ballot paper and the counting is done manually, hence it consumes a lot of time. There can be possibility of invalid votes. All these make election a tedious task. In our proposed system voting, counting is done with the help of computer, which saves time, avoid error in counting and there will be no invalid votes. It makes the election process easy. </span>
